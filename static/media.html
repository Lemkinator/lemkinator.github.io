      <h2>What is Cinematic/Freestyle FPV?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>First-person view (FPV)</b> is a method where a radio-controlled aircraft (drone) is piloted
          remotely from a first-person perspective via an onboard camera, fed wirelessly to video FPV goggles.</li>
        <li><b>Freestyle FPV</b> is all about flying skills and doing nice tricks or movements.</li>
        <li><b>Cinematic FPV</b> content tends to be slower and smoother than Freestyle FPV.
          The settings are chosen more for their visual attraction than for the technical flying skills they demand.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1> Accelerate - Impressions</h1>



      <h2>What is special about FPV?</h2>
      <p>The difference to normal drone pilots is that FPV pilots mostly build their drone themselves.</p>
      <p>This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Search and buy parts</li>
        <li>Assembling the drone</li>
        <li>Setting up the drone (Software)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, it requires much more practice, since FPV drones are usually flown in
        acro mode (acrobatic mode: e.g. when releasing the control sticks, the drone does not
        automatically level itself or if you move the sticks forward, the drone will pitch forward continuously
        instead of accelerating forward...).</p>
      <p>But the practice is worth it, because flying FPV is incredibly fun!</p>

      <h2>What got me into FPV?</h2>
      <p>The journey began with a normal consumer drone...</p>
      <p>... but ended very early with a broken drone and the fact, that its nearly impossible
        to repair those drones by your own.</p>
      <p>Since the repair at the manufacturer is quite expensive, i decided to build a drone myself...
        Which turned out not to be cheaper... :D</p>
      <p>After researching for the needed parts, the assembly began.</p>
      <p>Assembling and wiring...</p>
      <p>Getting the Hardware ready...</p>
      <p>Setup and configuration of the software...</p>
      <p>Done!</p>
      <p>Well... seems a lot more durable than the drone before...</p>
